List all the student details studying in fourth semester ‘C’ section.

select s.*
from student s, semsec ss, class c
WHERE ss.ssid = c.ssid
AND c.usn = s.usn
AND ss.sem = 4
AND ss.section = 'C';

Compute the total number of male and female students in each semester and in each section.

SELECT SS.sem, SS.section, S.gender, COUNT(*)
FROM semsec SS, class C,student S
WHERE SS.ssid = C.ssid AND S.usn = C.usn
GROUP BY SS.sem ,SS.section , S.gender;

Create a view of Test1 marks of student USN ‘1SJ17CS01’ in all subjects.

create view stu_view as
( select subcode, test1
from iamarks
where usn = '1SJ17CS01');

select * from stu_view;

Categorize students based on the following criterion:
If FinalIA = 17 to 20 then CAT = ‘Outstanding’
If FinalIA = 12 to 16 then CAT = ‘Average’
If FinalIA< 12 then CAT = ‘Weak’
Give these details only for 2th semester A, B, and C section students.

SELECT i.usn, s.sem, s.section, i.subcode,
CASE
WHEN final >= 17 AND final <= 20 THEN 'Outstanding'
WHEN final >= 12 AND final <= 16 THEN 'Average'
ELSE 'Weak'
END AS CAT
FROM iamarks i, class c,semsec s
where i.usn = c.usn
and s.ssid = c.ssid
and s.sem = 2
and s.section in ('A', 'B', 'C'); 

Calculate the FinalIA (average of best two test marks) and update the corresponding table for all students.

CREATE VIEW finalia AS
(SELECT usn, subcode,
GREATEST(AVG(test1 + test2) / 2,AVG(test1 + test3) / 2,AVG(test2 + test3) / 2) AS finalia
FROM iamarks
GROUP BY usn , subcode);

UPDATE iamarks i set final=(SELECT finalia from finalia f where i.usn=f.usn and
i.subcode=f.subcode);
